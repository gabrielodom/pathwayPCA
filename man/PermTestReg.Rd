\usage{
PermTestReg(OmicsReg, pathwayPCs_ls, numReps = 1000, parallel = FALSE,
  numCores = NULL, ...)

\S4method{PermTestReg}{OmicsReg}(OmicsReg, pathwayPCs_ls, numReps = 1000,
  parallel = FALSE, numCores = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{OmicsReg}{A data object of class \code{OmicsReg}, created by the
\code{\link{CreateOmics}} function.}

\item{pathwayPCs_ls}{A list of pathway PC matrices returned by the
\code{\link{ExtractAESPCs}} function.}

\item{numReps}{How many permuted models to fit? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{parallel}{Should the computation be completed in parallel? Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{numCores}{If \code{parallel = TRUE}, how many cores should be used for
computation? Internally defaults to the number of available cores minus 2.}

\item{...}{Dots for additional internal arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A named vector of pathway permutation \eqn{p}-values.

\description{
Given an \code{OmicsReg} object and a list of pathway PCs from
  the \code{\link{ExtractAESPCs}} function, test if each pathway with
  features recorded in the bio-assay design matrix is significantly related
  to the continuous response.
}
\details{
This function takes in a list of the first principal components
  from each pathway and an object of class \code{OmicsReg}. This function
  will then calculate the AIC of a multivariate linear model (via the
  \code{\link[stats]{lm}} function) with the original observations as
  response and the pathway principal components as the predictor matrix.

  Then, this function will create \code{numReps} permutations of the
  regression response, fit models to each of these permuted responses
  (holding the path predictor matrix fixed), and calculate the AIC of each
  model. This function will return a named vector of permutation
  \eqn{p}-values, where the value for each pathway is the proportion of
  models for which the AIC of the permuted response model is less than the
  AIC of the original model.
