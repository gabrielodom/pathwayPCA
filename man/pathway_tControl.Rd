\title{Calculate pathway-specific Student's \eqn{t}-scores from a null distribution
   for supervised PCA}
\usage{
pathway_tControl(pathway_vec, geneArray_df, response_mat,
  responseType = c("survival", "regression", "categorical"),
  n.threshold = 20, numPCs = 1, min.features = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_vec}{A character vector of the measured -Omes in the chosen
gene pathway. These should match a subset of the rownames of the gene
array.}

\item{geneArray_df}{A "tall" pathway data frame (\eqn{p \times N}). Each
subject or tissue sample is a column, and the rows are the -Ome
measurements for that sample.}

\item{response_mat}{A response matrix corresponding to \code{responseType}.
For \code{"regression"} and \code{"categorical"}, this will be an
\eqn{N \times 1} matrix of response values. For \code{"survival"}, this
will be an \eqn{N \times 2} matrix with event times in the first column
and observed event indicator in the second.}

\item{responseType}{A character string. Options are \code{"survival"},
\code{"regression"}, and \code{"categorical"}.}

\item{n.threshold}{The number of bins into which to split the feature scores
in the \code{fit} object returned internally by the
\code{\link{superpc.train}} function.}

\item{numPCs}{The number of PCs to extract from the pathway.}

\item{min.features}{What is the smallest number of genes allowed in each
pathway? This argument must be kept constant across all calls to this
function which use the same pathway list. Defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{numPCs} rows and \code{n.threshold} columns.
   The matrix values are model \eqn{t}-statisics for each PC included (rows)
   at each threshold level (columns).
}
\description{
Randomly permute or parametrically resample the response vector
   before model analysis. Then extract principal components (PCs) from the
   gene pathway, and return the test statistics associated with the first
   \code{numPCs} principal components at a set of threshold values based on
   the permuted values of the response.
}
\details{
This is a wrapper function to call \code{\link{superpc.train}}
   and \code{\link{superpc.st}} after response parametric bootstrapping with
   the \code{\link{randomControlSample}} suite of functions. This response
   sampling will act as a null distribution against which to compare
   the results from the \code{\link{pathway_tScores}} function.

   This wrapper is designed to facilitate apply calls (in parallel or
   serially) of these two functions over a list of gene pathways. When
   \code{numPCs} is equal to 1, we recommend using a simplify-style apply
   variant, such as \code{sapply} (shown in \code{\link[base]{lapply}}) or
   \code{parSapply} (shown in \code{\link[parallel]{clusterApply}}), then
   transposing the resulting matrix.
