\title{Write a \code{pathwaySet} Object to a \code{.gmt} File}
\usage{
write_gmt(pathwaySet, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwaySet}{A \code{pathwaySet} list of pathways. This list contains
the following three elements:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{pathways} : }{A named list of character vectors. Each vector
    contains the names of the individual genes within that pathway as a
    vector of character strings. Genes can be represented by HGNC gene
    symbols, Entrez IDs, Ensembl IDs, GO terms, etc. }
  \item{\code{TERMS} : }{A character vector the same length as the
    \code{pathways} list with the proper names of the pathways.}
  \item{\code{description} : }{A character vector the same length as the
    \code{pathways} list with a note on that pathway (such as a url to the
    description of the pathway). If this element of \code{pathwaySet} is
    \code{NULL}, then the file will be written with \code{""} (the empty
    character string) as its second field in each line.}
}}

\item{file}{Either a character string naming a file or a connection open for
writing. File names should end in \code{.gmt} for clarity}
}
\description{
Write a \code{pathwaySet} object as a pathways list file in
   Gene Matrix Transposed (\code{.gmt}) format.
