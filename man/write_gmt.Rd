\title{Write a \code{pathwayCollection} Object to a \code{.gmt} File}
\usage{
write_gmt(pathwayCollection, file, setType = c("pathways", "genes",
  "regions"))
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayCollection}{A \code{pathwayCollection} list of sets. This
list contains the following two or three elements:
\itemize{
  \item{'setType' : }{A named list of character vectors. Each vector
    contains the names of the individual genes, sites, or CpGs within
    that set as a vector of character strings. If you are using genes, 
    these genes can be represented by HGNC gene symbols, Entrez IDs,
    Ensembl IDs, GO terms, etc.}
  \item{\code{TERMS} : }{A character vector the same length as the
    'setType' list with the proper names of the sets.}
  \item{\code{description} : }{An optional character vector the same
    length as the 'setType' list with a note on that set (such as a url
    to the description if the set is a pathway). If this element of the
    \code{pathwayCollection} is \code{NULL}, then the file will be
    written with \code{""} (the empty character string) as its second
    field in each line.}
}}

\item{file}{Either a character string naming a file or a connection open for
writing. File names should end in \code{.gmt} for clarity.}

\item{setType}{What is the type of the set: pathway set of gene, gene sites
in RNA or DNA, or regions of CpGs. Defaults to \code{''pathway''}.}
}
\value{
NULL. Output written to the file path specified.
}

Write a \code{pathwayCollection} object as a pathways list file
   in Gene Matrix Transposed (\code{.gmt}) format.
