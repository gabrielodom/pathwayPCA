\title{Read a \code{.gmt} file in as a \code{pathwayCollection} object}
\usage{
read_gmt(file, setType = c("pathways", "genes", "regions"),
  description = FALSE, delim = "\\t")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A path to a file or a connection. This file must be a \code{.gmt}
file, otherwise input will likely be nonsense. See the "Details" section
for more information.}

\item{setType}{What is the type of the set: pathway set of gene, gene sites
in RNA or DNA, or regions of CpGs. Defaults to \code{''pathway''}.}

\item{description}{Should the "description" field (the second field in the
\code{.gmt} file on each line) be included in the output? Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{delim}{The \code{.gmt} delimiter. As proper \code{.gmt} files are tab
delimited, this defaults to \code{"\\t"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{pathwayCollection} list of sets. This list has three
   elements:
\itemize{
  \item{'setType' : }{A named list of character vectors. Each vector
     contains the names of the individual genes, sites, or CpGs within that
     set as a vector of character strings. The name of this list entry is
     equal to the value specified in \code{setType}.}
  \item{\code{TERMS} : }{A character vector the same length as the 'setType'
     list with the proper names of the sets.}
  \item{\code{description} : }{ (OPTIONAL) A character vector the same length
     as the 'setType' list with a note on that set (for the \code{.gmt} file
     included with this package, this field contains hyperlinks to the
     MSigDB description card for that pathway). This field is included when
     \code{description = TRUE}.}
}
}
\description{
Read a set list file in Gene Matrix Transposed (\code{.gmt})
   format, with special performance consideration for large files. Present
   this object as a \code{pathwayCollection} object.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{R}'s \code{\link{readChar}} function to
   improve character input performance over \code{\link{readLines}} (and
   far improve input performance over \code{\link{scan}}).

   See the Broad Institute's "Data Formats" page for a description of the
   Gene Matrix Transposed file format:

    package = "pathwayPCA", mustWork = TRUE
  )
  geneset_ls <- read_gmt(data_path, description = TRUE)
