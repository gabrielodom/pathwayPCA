\title{Extract AES-PCs from recorded pathway-subsets of a mass spectrometry or
  bio-assay data frame}
\usage{
ExtractAESPCs(object, numPCs = 1, parallel = FALSE, numCores = NULL,
  standardPCA = FALSE, ...)

\S4method{ExtractAESPCs}{OmicsPathway}(object, numPCs = 1,
  parallel = FALSE, numCores = NULL, standardPCA = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{OmicsPathway}.}

\item{numPCs}{The number of PCs to extract from each pathway. Defaults to 1.}

\item{parallel}{Should the computation be completed in parallel? Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{numCores}{If \code{parallel = TRUE}, how many cores should be used for
computation? Internally defaults to the number of available cores minus 2.}

\item{standardPCA}{Should the function return the AES-PCA PCs and loadings
(\code{FALSE}) or the standard PCA PCs and loadings (\code{TRUE})? Defaults
to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Dots for additional internal arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Two lists of matrices: \code{PCs} and \code{loadings}. Each element
  of both lists will be named by its pathway. The elements of the \code{PCs}
  list will be \eqn{N \times} \code{numPCs} matrices containing the first
  \code{numPCs} principal components from each pathway. The elements of the
  \code{loadings} list will be \code{numPCs} \eqn{\times p} projection
  matrices containing the loadings corresponding to the first \code{numPCs}
  principal components from each pathway. See "Details" for more information.
}
\description{
Given a clean \code{OmicsPath} object (cleaned by the
  \code{\link{IntersectOmicsPwyCollct}} function), extract the first
  principal components (PCs) from each pathway with features recorded in the
  assay design matrix.
}
\details{
This function takes in a data frame with named columns and a pathway
  list as an \code{OmicsPathway} object which has had unrecorded -Omes
  removed from the corresponding pathway collection by the
  \code{\link{IntersectOmicsPwyCollct}} function. This function will then
  iterate over the list of pathways, extracting columns from the assay design
  matrix which match the genes listed in that pathway as a sub-matrix (as a
  \code{data.frame} object). This function will then call the
  \code{\link{aespca}} on each data frame in the list of pathway-specific
  design matrices, extracting the first \code{numPCs} AES principal
  components from each pathway data frame. These PC matrices are returned as
  a named list.

  NOTE: some genes will be included in more than one pathway, so these
  pathways are not mutually exclusive. Further note that there may be many
  genes in the assay design matrix that are not included in the pathways,
  so these will not be extracted to the list. It is then vitally important to
  use either a very broad and generic list of pathways or a pathways list
  that is compatible to the assay data supplied.
