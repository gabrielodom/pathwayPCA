#' @description Gene Pathway Sets from <WEBSITE HERE>
#'
#' @format A list of three elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{pathways : }{A list of 1304 character vectors. Each vector contains
#'     the names of the individual genes within that pathway as a vector of
#'     character strings.}
#'   \item{TERMS : }{A character vector of length 1304 containing the names of
#'     the gene pathways.}
#'   \item{setsize : }{A named integer vector of length 1304 containing the
#'     number of genes in each gene pathway.}
#' }
